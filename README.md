# cocoro

This project is mainly designed for my personal use. It aims to provide friendly interface
of coroutine functionality, which is originated from
[cserv](https://github.com/sysprog21/cserv) and work in process now.

Note: Only `x86_64` architecture is supported now.
## TODO List

- [x] await and yield implementation
- [ ] Event driven scheduler
- [ ] Priority for different coroutine
- [ ] ...more feature / general purpose interface
